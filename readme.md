# Carousel Collection View with Custom Flow Layout

This project shows you how to make a carousel-style image gallery using UICollectionView with a custom flow layout. The carousel effect includes smooth transitions between images, where the central image is made bigger, while the side images are made smaller and moved a little to the side. It uses a custom UICollectionViewFlowLayout to handle item positioning, scaling, and shifting as the user scrolls horizontally.

- Items in the carousel are dynamically scaled and shifted based on their position relative to the centre of the screen.
- Items not in the centre are blurred, which makes them stand out more and draws attention to the central item.
